# Reverse an Array

Takes in an array and returns an int array with the same information in reverse order.

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I worked with Stephen to outline how we wanted to solve the challenge. Then wrote a function with a loop that iterates through an inputed array.
